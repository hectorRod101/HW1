In this assignment, you will create an Android application to display the following table on the screen. 

In the AndroidManifest.xml layout resource file there are two things to do when running the different implementations.
This will be the output of AndroidManifest.xml.

    This runs Java API code 
        <activity android:name=".secondActivity">
                                         
                                           
    This runs Layout Resource File
        <activity android:name=".MainActivity">
                                            
                                            
To run Java API implementation, make sure android:name".secondActivity" is not commented out.
To run Layout Resource File implementation, make sure android:name".MainActivity" is not commmented out. 
Make sure one or the other is commented out, both cannot run at the same time when compiled or replace .secondActivity with .MainActivity and vice versa.

Java API implementation code is under /app/java/secondActivity.
Layout Resource File code is under /app/res/layout and implements id declaration, more code under /app/java/MainActivity.
